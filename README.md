# -High-Noon-Guy-Discord-Bot

Created by Edward Weinberger

Requires node.js and the discord.js libraries
Channel ID, Server ID, and token should be replaced with your Channel and bot specific info to run your specific bot
This will send a single message everyday.
    (change the first variable in setHours(based on a 24hr clock) in the leftToNoon function)
Users can interact with the bot in 3 simple ways
    *Call and responce(including listing the commands)
    *Simple RNG minigame
    *A RPS Game(also has RNG for botpick)
    
That's about it. Made this for fun.
Thanks for reading
